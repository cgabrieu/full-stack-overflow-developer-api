## How It Works

See sample requests and responses

- See all unanswered questions [here](https://fsoverflow.herokuapp.com/questions) (GET /questions)

- See the answers to a specific question [here](https://fsoverflow.herokuapp.com/questions/1) (GET /questions/QUESTION_ID), when not answered [here](https://fsoverflow.herokuapp.com/questions/3)

- See the ranking by points [here](https://fsoverflow.herokuapp.com/ranking)

- To answer a question you need to create a user to get your authorization token:
#### Make a POST /users:
```json
{
  "name": "Marcio",
  "class": "T3" 
}
```
It will return a json web token:
```json
{
  "token": "xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz"
}
```

<br/>

- If you create a question with an uncreated user, it will also return an authentication token:
#### Make a POST /questions:
```json
{
  "question": "Quando se deve usar 'var' no JavaScript?",
  "student": "JoÃ£o Pedro",
  "class": "T2",
  "tags": "javascript, var"
}
```
It will return the question id and user authentication token:
```json
{
  "questionId": 2,
  "userToken": "xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz"
}
```

<br/>

- To answer a question:
#### Make a POST /questions:QUESTION_ID :
```json
{
  "answer": "Ã‰ um mecanismo de controle de fluxo que visa beneficiar processos assÃ­ncronos." 
}
```
It will return status code 200 created. Make sure you're sending a header in the format:
```
  BEARER xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz
```

- To up vote a question (increase one point), make a PUT /questions/QUESTION_ID/up-vote

- To down vote a question (decrease one point), make a PUT /questions/QUESTION_ID/down-vote
